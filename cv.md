### About myself:
I'm a pharmacist who want to become a frontend-developer. Since I left my job as a specialist of pharmaceutical procurement procedures I have studied JS. So when I found RSS JS-course I thought it's a good opportunity to improve skills. 

I'm a hardworking person who like to teach and help other people. I believe that my love to learn new things and perseverance will lead me to my goal.

### Code example:
**RGB To Hex Conversion (from Codewars):** *The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.*
```
function rgb(r, g, b){
  return `${numberToHex(r)}${numberToHex(g)}${numberToHex(b)}`.toUpperCase() ;
}

function numberToHex (num) {
  let hexNum = (num < 0) ? '00' : (num > 255) ? 'FF' : num.toString(16);
  return (hexNum.length === 1) ? '0' + hexNum : hexNum;
 }
```
