### About myself:
I'm a pharmacist who want to become a frontend-developer. Since I left my job as a specialist of pharmaceutical procurement procedures I have studied JS. So when I found RSS JS-course I thought it's a good opportunity to improve skills. 

I'm a hardworking person who like to teach and help other people. I believe that my love to learn new things and perseverance will lead me to my goal.

### Code example:
**Regex validate PIN code (from Codewars):** *ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits. If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.*
```
function validatePIN (pin) {
  if (pin.length == 4 || pin.length == 6) {
    for (let num of pin) {
      if (num != '0' && !parseInt(num)) return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
